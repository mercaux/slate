# Introduction

Welcome to the Mercaux Public API! You can use this API to access Looks, Alternatives, Recommendations etc.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "X-MercauxApikey: XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX"
```

> Make sure to replace `XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX` with your API key.

Mercaux uses API keys to allow access to the API. You will need to ask your Mercaux manager to get one.

API expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`X-MercauxApikey: XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Paging

> To get first portion of data, just use normal request as described in documentation.

```shell
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "X-MercauxApikey: XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX"
```
> To get all next portions of data, add `X-MercauxPagingData` header. Copy it intact from previous response. 

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "X-MercauxApikey: XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX"
  -H "X-MercauxPagingData: pagingData"
```

> Make sure to replace `XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX` with your API key.
> Make sure to replace `pagingData` with data from previous response.

Mercaux API has paging enabled. You may get 206 (Partial Content) code back with only partial content and "X-MercauxPagingData" header set.

That means you need to make another request with same URL, providing this header back as is to get next data portion.
